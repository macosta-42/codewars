# Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List

## Task

Your task is to make two functions, `max` and `min` that take an array of integers `list` as input and outputs, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that array.

## Examples

```
max({4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566}) returns 566
min({-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110}) returns -110
max({5}) returns 5
min({42, 54, 65, 87, 0}) returns 0
```

## Notes

You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays.
