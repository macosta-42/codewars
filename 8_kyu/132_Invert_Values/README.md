# Invert values

## Task

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. 
Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

```
invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
```

## Notes:

* All values are greater than INT_MIN
* The input should be modified, not returned.
