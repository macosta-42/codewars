# Total pressure calculation

## Task
Given the molecular mass of two molecules M1 and M2, their masses present m1 and m2 in a vessel of volume V at a specific temperature T, find the total pressure Ptotal total exerted by the molecules. 
Formula to calculate the pressure is:

Ptotal = (((m1 / M1) + (m2 / M2)) * RT / V)

## Input

Six values:
* M1, M2: molar masses of both gases, in grams (g)
* m1, m2: present mass of both gases, in g.mol^-1
* V: volume of the vessel, in dm^3
* T: temperature, in °C

## Output

One value: Ptotal, in units of atm.

## Notes

Remember: Temperature is given in Celsius while SI unit is Kelvin (K). 0°C = 273.15K
The gas constant  R = 0.082dm^3⋅atm⋅K^−1⋅mol^−1
